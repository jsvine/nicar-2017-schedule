Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we\u2019ll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.\n\nYou\u2019ll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.\n\nTarget audience: People with no or minimal exposure to programming who need a jumping off point to get their feet wet so they are prepared for programming classes at the conference.\n\nRequirements to attend: Laptop with administrative privileges\n\nMinimum technical specifications: Windows: Version 7 or higher; Mac: OS 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher. 4 GB of RAM, 15 GB of free hard-drive space. English layout keyboard strongly preferred.

You'll learn about the never-ending and amazing power of logical functions, as well as a whole bunch of other functions you probably didn't know about (but should). You'll also learn some handy tools for dealing with dates, times and strings of text that aren't quite the way you'd like them. Plus we'll throw in some other tricks that just make working in spreadsheets a bit easier and more efficient.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.\n\nWorkshop prerequisites: You should have prior experience using Excel or Google Sheets, and be comfortable with introductory-level spreadsheet skills, such as sorting, filtering, SUM and AVERAGE functions, calculations such as percentage change or percent of total, and how to use Pivot Tables.\n\nNOTE: Registration is required for this session.

Or if the 63.3 percent probability of winning a football game that we're reporting on could be rounded to 60 percent, and more clearly expressed as a 3 out of 5 chances? In some cases, statistics, as a discipline, can help us work out margins of error, but in other cases, the mathematics is frustratingly silent about the best strategy for expressing a range of plausible outcomes. How do we give data their wobble back?

Science is not far ahead of us -- look at the uncertainty cone in a hurricane, which lay readers often mistake for hurricane size. Look at how readers misinterpreted election predictions, even when they came with confidence intervals or likelihood measurements. How can we explain uncertainty better so that readers understand it? This is designed to be a hands-on collaborative workshop in which science communicators and visual journalists discuss the state of the art in visualizing uncertainty, then come up with some new directions via sketching and prototyping.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited.
