Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we\u2019ll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.\n\nYou\u2019ll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.\n\nTarget audience: People with no or minimal exposure to programming who need a jumping off point to get their feet wet so they are prepared for programming classes at the conference.\n\nRequirements to attend: Laptop with administrative privileges\n\nMinimum technical specifications: Windows: Version 7 or higher; Mac: OS 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher. 4 GB of RAM, 15 GB of free hard-drive space.

How do we deal with the push to focus on \"click bait\" material, or doing just about anything to get more web traffic? The focus on boosting web traffic eats up time that could be spent on other important coverage and seems to at times detract from the mission. In newsrooms across the country, money has become so tight that it rules everything that we do. It shouldn't, but it does affect coverage. What's the point of boosting web traffic if we aren't really fulfilling the real purpose of journalism, which is watchdogging and being the fourth estate? This conversation will allow journalists who struggle with these issues to connect and think of creative ways to deal.",

More open source software means more time for meaningful journalism, less time spent recreating code.

        "description": "Ida B. Wells reported on lynchings through simple, clear questions and a systematic collection and analysis of data. However, Wells could not report on racist violence from a detached vantage point. She had friends who were murdered and was herself exiled from her home in Memphis after her newspaper's office was ransacked and her life was threatened. Many buying homes or choosing schools for their children, including reporters and editors, are implicated in systems intertwined with race, class and politics. However, few acknowledge that they aren't detached from these systems. Last year, Nikole Hannah-Jones used her background reporting about race, segregation and education to show how [her own experience choosing a school for her daughter](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/choosing-a-school-for-my-daughter-in-a-segregated-city.html?_r=0) exemplified broader issues in American education. Lewis Wallace, a reporter for Marketplace, reported being fired after publishing an [essay](https://medium.com/@lewispants/objectivity-is-dead-and-im-okay-with-it-7fd2b4b5c58f#.yzkh8bigt) questioning the reality of standards of objectivity and neutrality in news and surfacing the struggles he faces as a trans person who is specifically affected by policy.\n\nLet's start by accepting that objectivity and neutrality aren't real and that there is a crisis of audience trust in reporting. Let's also aknowledge that reporters and editors are consciously or unconciously implicated in many of the dynamics on which they cover, yet still do rigorous work. Finally, let's agree that not everyone in a newsroom is impacted by newsworthy events in the same way.\n\nFrom this starting point, let's talk about different standards that journalists are developing, either in their own practice, or at their organizations to address our personal implications in the news. How can or should reporters disclose their connections or orientations? What are the implications, if any, if reporters participate in protests or donate to causes? How have reporters taken political actions but remained fair and truthful in the reporting? What were the times when this wasn't possible? From this conversation, I hope we can develop sets of standards, personal and organizational that prioritize both our humanity and the integrity of our journalism.",

But though our models come with uncertainty, we are sometimes bad at helping readers understand the uncertainty that\u2019s built into our work. Science is not far ahead of us -- look at the uncertainty cone in a hurricane, which lay readers often mistake for hurricane size. Look at how readers misinterpreted election predictions, even when they came with confidence intervals or likelihood measurements. How can we explain uncertainty better so that readers understand it? This is designed to be a hands-on collaborative workshop in which science communicators and visual journalists discuss the state of the art in visualizing uncertainty, then come up with some new directions via sketching and prototyping.\n\nPreregistration is required and seating is limited.
