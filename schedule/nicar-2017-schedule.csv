Techraking <=19: Bootstrapping the News (Sponsored by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting),Outside Event,"Register now!

Give us four hours and your laptop, and we’ll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.

One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we’ll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.

You’ll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.

Target audience: People with no or minimal exposure to programming who need a jumping off point to get their feet wet so they are prepared for programming classes at the conference.

Requirements to attend: Laptop with administrative privileges

Minimum technical specifications: Windows: Version 7 or higher; Mac: OS 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher. 4 GB of RAM, 15 GB of free hard-drive space. English layout keyboard strongly preferred. (Other layouts may work, but we've had trouble with certain characters in the past and our ability to provide tech support will be limited.)

Participants will walk away with a fully functioning dev machine (on their personal laptop) that includes: VirtualBox, Ubuntu/Xbuntu, Bower, csvkit, Django, Fabric, Git, Grunt, Ilene, MySQL, Node.js, NPM, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PANDAS, Python, QuantumGIS, R, RBENV, Rails, Ruby, SQLite, Tabula, virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper

Additional details including the schedule for the workshop can be found on the conference website.

Gentrification clues: Datasets that predict urban upheaval (Sponsored by Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism),Outside Event,"Free pre-conference workshop on Wednesday, March 1 from 2-5 p.m.

Evan Wyloge, senior reporter at AZCIR (the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting) has spent a decade focusing on accountability and watchdog reporting, with an emphasis on data analysis. In this workshop, he will identify disparate datasets that allow reporters to analyze the evolving economic landscape of metro areas.

Population density, incomes and property values, the overall volume of economic activity, and racial and ethnic diversity are all clues that can help reporters understand the dynamic shift toward a more urbanized population. Wyloge will show you how to navigate surprising databases and mine the key points to develop insightful stories on the future of your community.

Visualizing and understanding uncertainty (Sponsored by Society for News Design) **pre-registered attendees only,Hands-on,"Statistics is the science of uncertainty. It’s an invaluable tool for journalists trying to help readers and viewers make good choices with imperfect data. But though our models come with uncertainty, we are sometimes bad at helping readers understand the uncertainty that’s built into our work. Science is not far ahead of us -- look at the uncertainty cone in a hurricane, which lay readers often mistake for hurricane size. Look at how readers misinterpreted election predictions, even when they came with confidence intervals or likelihood measurements. How can we explain uncertainty better so that readers understand it? This is designed to be a hands-on collaborative workshop in which science communicators and visual journalists discuss the state of the art in visualizing uncertainty, then come up with some new directions via sketching and prototyping.

Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Computers will not be provided for this workshop so please bring your laptop.
