Techraking <=19: Bootstrapping the News (Sponsored by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting),Outside Event,"Register now!

Give us four hours and your laptop, and we’ll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.

One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we’ll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.

You’ll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.

Target audience: People with no or minimal exposure to programming who need a jumping off point to get their feet wet so they are prepared for programming classes at the conference.

Requirements to attend: Laptop with administrative privileges

Minimum technical specifications: Windows: Version 7 or higher; Mac: OS 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher. 4 GB of RAM, 15 GB of free hard-drive space. English layout keyboard strongly preferred. (Other layouts may work, but we've had trouble with certain characters in the past and our ability to provide tech support will be limited.)

Participants will walk away with a fully functioning dev machine (on their personal laptop) that includes: VirtualBox, Ubuntu/Xbuntu, Bower, csvkit, Django, Fabric, Git, Grunt, Ilene, MySQL, Node.js, NPM, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PANDAS, Python, QuantumGIS, R, RBENV, Rails, Ruby, SQLite, Tabula, virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper

Gentrification clues: Datasets that predict urban upheaval (Sponsored by Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism),Outside Event,"Free pre-conference workshop on Wednesday, March 1 from 2-5 p.m.

Evan Wyloge, senior reporter at AZCIR (the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting) has spent a decade focusing on accountability and watchdog reporting, with an emphasis on data analysis. In this workshop, he will identify disparate datasets that allow reporters to analyze the evolving economic landscape of metro areas.

Population density, incomes and property values, the overall volume of economic activity, and racial and ethnic diversity are all clues that can help reporters understand the dynamic shift toward a more urbanized population. Wyloge will show you how to navigate surprising databases and mine the key points to develop insightful stories on the future of your community.

Conversations: Journalism's bottom line (Sponsored by SRCCON - OpenNews),Special Event,"This conversation will brainstorm coping strategies and solutions for working in corporate news and the roadblocks that come with it. How do we deal with the push to focus on ""click bait"" material, or doing just about anything to get more web traffic? The focus on boosting web traffic eats up time that could be spent on other important coverage and seems to at times detract from the mission. In newsrooms across the country, money has become so tight that it rules everything that we do. It shouldn't, but it does affect coverage. What's the point of boosting web traffic if we aren't really fulfilling the real purpose of journalism, which is watchdogging and being the fourth estate? This conversation will allow journalists who struggle with these issues to connect and think of creative ways to deal.",Janelle O'Dea,2017-03-02,09:00,10:00,1.0,City Terrace 12,2702/2974,https://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2974/

The agile data analyst: Applying practices from agile software methodologies to data reporting,Panel,"Software developers have spent a great deal of time and effort honing workflows that make their work easier, especially when they work in teams. Many of these best practices have been codified in the principles of Agile software development. Data reporters generally lack a shared set of conventions and practices, and that lack can make it tricky to share work and collaborate. This session will bring together news apps developers and reporters specializing in data-driven journalism to discuss what an agile workflow would look like on the reporting side. From iteration planning to time boxing to the DRY principle, we'll wring some sense from the buzz words and see which ones might make the work of data analysis more productive, more predictable and more fun.

Conversations: Beyond objectivity - New standards for building trust in journalism (Sponsored by SRCCON - OpenNews),Special Event,"Ida B. Wells reported on lynchings through simple, clear questions and a systematic collection and analysis of data. However, Wells could not report on racist violence from a detached vantage point. She had friends who were murdered and was herself exiled from her home in Memphis after her newspaper's office was ransacked and her life was threatened. Many buying homes or choosing schools for their children, including reporters and editors, are implicated in systems intertwined with race, class and politics. However, few acknowledge that they aren't detached from these systems. Last year, Nikole Hannah-Jones used her background reporting about race, segregation and education to show how [her own experience choosing a school for her daughter](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/magazine/choosing-a-school-for-my-daughter-in-a-segregated-city.html?_r=0) exemplified broader issues in American education. Lewis Wallace, a reporter for Marketplace, reported being fired after publishing an [essay](https://medium.com/@lewispants/objectivity-is-dead-and-im-okay-with-it-7fd2b4b5c58f#.yzkh8bigt) questioning the reality of standards of objectivity and neutrality in news and surfacing the struggles he faces as a trans person who is specifically affected by policy.

Let's start by accepting that objectivity and neutrality aren't real and that there is a crisis of audience trust in reporting. Let's also aknowledge that reporters and editors are consciously or unconciously implicated in many of the dynamics on which they cover, yet still do rigorous work. Finally, let's agree that not everyone in a newsroom is impacted by newsworthy events in the same way.

From this starting point, let's talk about different standards that journalists are developing, either in their own practice, or at their organizations to address our personal implications in the news. How can or should reporters disclose their connections or orientations? What are the implications, if any, if reporters participate in protests or donate to causes? How have reporters taken political actions but remained fair and truthful in the reporting? What were the times when this wasn't possible? From this conversation, I hope we can develop sets of standards, personal and organizational that prioritize both our humanity and the integrity of our journalism.",Geoff Hing,2017-03-03,11:30,12:30,1.0,City Terrace 12,2702/2980,https://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2980/

Data & abuse of power,Panel,"We need data on public institutions so that we can keep them accountable. But when that data is collected and shared by the institution itself, they are in a powerful position to control the narrative. What can we as data practitioners do to help identify potentially biased narratives that could exist in this type of data? Because blindly trusting a biased dataset is just as harmful as blindly trusting a biased source. We would like to talk a little about a vetting process, and about a few important types of biases in data that you should have in mind. This list is by no means complete and is still a work in progress, but it includes some of the more major types of bias that we’ve noticed in data, and what we think you can do about them.","Anna Flagg, Moiz Syed",2017-03-03,15:30,16:30,1.0,Conference Center B,2702/2914,https://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2914/
Data journalism from space,Demo,"For decades, time-sensitive satellite imagery has been expensive and accessible mostly to governments and large corporations.

The high frequency of Planet's imagery creates new opportunities to capture insight on significant local and global change and is able to move at the rapid rate of today’s 24-hour news cycle. Recent stories include coverage of deforestation in Bolivia, illegal gold mining in Peru, a collapsing glacier, and discovery of North Korean missile tests. As a unique source of data, Planet's imagery is available to approved journalists and socially-impactful projects.","Sara Schnadt,",2017-03-03,15:30,16:30,1.0,River Terrace 2,2702/2915,https://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2915/
